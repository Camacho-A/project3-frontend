### About dotBEAT
Music has the ability to bring people together. It has the power to transcend language barriers, to cross social and cultural boundaries, and to connect people in a way that nothing else can. No matter what your taste in music, there is always a song that can bring people together. Whether it’s a shared love of a particular artist or genre, or simply a catchy tune that gets everyone moving. So next time you’re looking for a way to bond with someone, try sharing a song. You might just find that music is the perfect way to connect with someone on a deeper level.
